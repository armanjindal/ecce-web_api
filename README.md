# ecce-web_api
A basic web-api built with Flask for Ecce. Simple hosting on Heroku, serving media files so they display on RasaX, and for the transition to WhatsApp. 

Planning on migrating this to Django, where I can also host the Response Server + Backend database. Learning how to do that soon! 

TODOs:
- [ ] Convert MP4s to Gifs and check how they display on WhatsApp outpt channel
