# ecce-web_api
A basic web-api built with Flask for Ecce. Currently simply hosting and serving local media files so they display on RasaX, and for the transition to WhatsApp. 

Planning on migrating this to Django, where I can also host the Response Server + Backend database. Learning how to do that soon!
